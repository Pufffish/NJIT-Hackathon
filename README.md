# HackNJIT

A python webscraper to extract data from popular webites to retrieve price data. The overall goal was to have a finished product that was a website to host the code and show the best options for any sort of camping equipment. Currently it is a work in progress by Allie He, Meer Modi, Eric Lin, and Dhruvil Kansara. Some issues that were faced was getting information from multiple pages. So far, we have been only to get all of the items from a single web page. We shall continue to work on this and improve. This code is based off of work done by Dhruvil Kansara who is a senior at NJIT. We also used online documentation for each module that we imported and watched a couple of YouTube videos. For any contributions please create a pull request or email me at dsk54@njit.edu.
